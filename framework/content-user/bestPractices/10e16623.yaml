  We wanted to better support software developers to meet

  the accessibility needs of diverse end users. We designed a

  tool to help capture a range of personas representing diverse

  end users, providing developers with support during software

  design to consider a wide range of issues such end users

  may encounter when trying to use their software. Our tool

  provides personas for a range of common end user accessibility challenges, as well as key goals and frustrations such

  users have for e-shopping and e-education platforms, together

  with a curated set of recommended guidelines for addressing

  these issues. During evaluation of our prototype tool our study

  participants agreed that the tool helped them to be more aware

  of a wide range of diverse end-user challenges and to increase

  their empathy so that they could effectively develop more userfriendly software for them.
summary: |-
  To address this
  issue, we designed a curated persona and design guidelines tool
  to help developers consider and address diverse end-user needs
  during the software development process. Our tool helps software
  development teams to take a more holistic view of human nature
  and diverse end-uses during the software development cycle and
  to design software with multiple diverse end-user needs in mind.
  Our evaluation with 23 real world software developers shows
  that the use of such human-centric persona and guideline tools
  in the early stages of software development can help to reduce
  software end-user bias and increase software accessibility.
