  The cohort of children between 2 to 14 years of age can be further divided into distinct groups. In general, children in the groups with 2-5, 6-10, and 11-14 years of age of age have slightly different testing requirements; therefore, it is important to specifically determine your target testing group. Children younger than 2.5 years are typically not proficient enough with standard input devices to interact with technology and provide useful data. Children older than 14 years will behave as adults in a testing situation and should be treated accordingly.
