summary: Designing video games for the blind
bestPractices: >-
  - Meaningful audio or tactile feedback is important and needs to
  be considered when designing for blind people

  - Participants were recruited via email from the National Federation for the Blind in Baltimore Maryland, recruitment from similar organisations can be a good place to find participants
methodology: Observational & qualitative interview questionnaire for the 6 blind
  participants aged 18-40. Participants were allowed to familiarise themselves
  with the laptop before testing. Analysis used the Non-Functional Requirements
  Framework, and tools from grounded theory method (GTM). Open and axial coding
  was applied to the data.
tools: The game Ninja Cactus was played on a Dell Inspiron 15 laptop which, was
  user tested for software glitches.
notesOfCaution: Specific participant criteria can lead to low recruitment numbers.
