cohorts:
  - vision impaired
subCohorts:
  - blind and vision impaired
keywords:
  - blind
  - blindfolded
  - sensors
  - observations
summary: Tests a wearable device as a navigation system, which gives tactile feedback
notes: |-
  - 4 BVI and 4 blinfolded people used
  - virtual training and real field tests
methodology: >-
  - observational

  - obstacle-free field tests

  - triple visual landmarks used for localisation purposes

  - inner clock orientation exercise is the most popular orientation finding training method for BVI people
tools: >-
  - tactile wristband with bluetooth module to receive guidance messages

  - flight control game joystick (PXN-2113 Pro) used for participant to give feedback regarding the perceived direction

  - drone used as an observer
terminology: BVI = blind and vision impaired
notesOfCaution: "- be aware of the different skin sensitivities people have"
