summary: Terms to use for visual disabilities
bestPractices: Visual impairment is a widely used term to refer to a spectrum of
  people with a visual disability, but impaired has the connotation that these
  people are damaged. The word blind can also be used as a blanket term for
  anyone with a visual disability, which may not be accurate. In general, terms
  and mentalities fail to account for the spectrum and diversity of visual
  impairments. A more empowering term to use may be "visually diverse" to
  describe the spectrum of visual abilities.
