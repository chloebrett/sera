targetAudience: Computer professionals assessing the usability of computer
  products with children
findings: Arrange the furnishings as unobtrusively as possible while still being
  effective.
summary: How to arrange laboratory equipment
notes: A usability testing lab is is a quiet room set up with computer equipment
  as well as a camera to record interactions, and a one-way mirror to an
  observation room.
bestPractices: Make sure to place microphones close to children to pick up their
  soft voices, but opt for smaller ones over large ones. Avoid setting up
  furniture that faces children directly towards the video camera or the one-way
  mirror. The reason for this is because children can easily become distracted
  seeing their reflection or imagining themselves on camera.
methodology: Usability testing, Interview, Observational
tools: Usability testing Lab.
