summary: Impact of cognitive impairement on memory and communication
bestPractices: Individuals experiencing cognitive impairment may have concerns
  relating to decreasing memory. This can effect an individual's processing and
  understanding new scenarios and therefore ensuring that adequate time for
  informed consent and process explanations is recommended.
terminology: Decline in memory is divided into three, namely normal cognition,
  mild cognitive cognition and dementia
notesOfCaution: Individuals may become frustrated if they realise they have
  forgotten something or are not understanding what is being told to them.
  Redirection away from their subject of concern may assist to divert further
  emotional distress as well as give the participant a new target of focus.
