  * "CCDs typically lead to difficulty with conversational discourse, which
  has been described as occurring across a spectrum ranging from deficient and
  impoverished output to excessive talkativeness with poor turn taking and
  repetitiveness (Snow, Douglas, & Ponsford, 1998)."

  * "Words often used to describe CCDs

  in everyday terms include “subtle communication deficits,” “personality change,” “not the same person as before the injury”; in worst-case scenarios, a person may be described as “difficult,” “offensive,” “awkward,” and/or “insensitive.” Capturing the nature of these difficulties"

  *CHECK THESE PAPERS  - considerable progress made in the conceptualization of CCDs (MacDonald, 2017; McDonald et al., 2012).

  * Hagen 1984 - "Cognitive disorganization was reflected through language use characterized by irrelevant utterances that

  may not make sense, difficulty inhibiting inappropriate utterances, word-finding difficulties, and problems ordering words

  and propositions."

  * A genre is a particular text type that has its own structure, sequence, and purpose. Some types of discourse genres include narrative (recounting a story), procedural (a set of instructions for doing something), expository (giving an

  opinion or discussing a topic in detail), and conversation

  * "Definition - ""Cognitive communication disorders (CCDs)

  comprise a unique set of communication difficulties that can arise from a range of

  neurological insults including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and right hemisphere

  damage (RHD) associated with stroke or other causes, such as brain tumor. CCDs

  are ubiquitous for people with moderate to severe TBI;""

  CCDs states the person has difficulties with listening, speaking, reading, written expression, or social interaction that occur due to underlying problems with cognitive skills such as attention, memory, organization, reasoning, social cognition, or executive functions (CASLPO, 2015)"

  Genre discourse terms are used to sheds light on the communication difficulties of people with TBI rather than relying on standardized tests developed for aphasia?

  Patterns that can be expected when working with those with cognitive impairments or cognitive communication disorders (CCDs):

  - Communication trends do occur on a spectrum and therefore varies between individuals, however speech can vary from deficient or simplistic to unrestrained talkativeness. Individuals can also tend to repeat points or struggle with turn taking when speaking. 

  - they may struggle with finding the correct work they desire or structuring of sentences. 

  - Due to underlying cognitive skill impairments, individuals may also struggle with "attention, memory organisation, reasoning, social cognition or executive functions."(Caslpo, 2015)"
