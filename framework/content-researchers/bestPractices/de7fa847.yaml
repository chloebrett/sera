paperName: A Blind Personâ€™s Interactions with Technology
paperLink: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1536616.1536636
cohorts:
  - vision impaired
subCohorts:
  - blind
keywords:
  - congenitally blind
findings: Technology and other tasks sometimes provided limitations but
  participant used workarounds that sometimes were more inefficient or made her
  less independent. Functionality and socially situated meaning will determine
  who uses technology and how it will be used.
summary: In-depth exploratory and descriptive case study of a blind person using
  various technology within her home
bestPractices: >-
  - A home environment was used to better represent nuances of
  using technology everyday as a blind person

  - Studying a single person allowed an in-depth investigation that brought out themes and patterns that may have been missed otherwise, studying a single person was made recruitment easier
methodology: This was an in-depth exploratory and descriptive case study of a
  single participant, inspired by ethnographical investigations similar to
  social and behavioural sciences. Although generalisations cannot be made using
  this method. The one participant was interviewed and recorded six times over
  four weeks. This method was adapted from from Blythe et al "Technology
  Biographies".
