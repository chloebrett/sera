summary: >-
  Quote:"Because older adults are a group of participants who are
  vulnerable and may experience difficulties

  they are given an explanation of the purpose of the study, the problem of decreasing memory of

  cognitive function memories in daily activities and proposing technology to help memory problems" 

  * ^ Very thorough explanation of study, ensuring they understand. 

  What i take from this, is ensuring patience and extra time is inbuilt to ensure that debrief and informed consent can be done indepth with each member

  Quote:"they feel confused and try to recall when they forget." -> redirection can be a good strategy here so move them on quickly if they do forget so that they do not end up in an emotionally distressed state.
notes: >-
  * men aged 60-65 and women 60-63

  * semi structured interview

  * before one experiences dementia they experience a cognitive disorder MCI but otherwise act normal

  * Random: "Indonesia is expected to experience the largest increase in older adults in the world, between 1990-2025, which amounted to 414%"

  * "prevalence of MCI in 6 developed countries, such as the USA, Australia, Germany, Britain, Switzerland and France is 15% -42%"

  * Just talks alot and justifies about how the problem of cognitive decline in Indonesia has a solution which is technological involvement

  * Mentions VR, "serious games" or training games, Computerized cognitive training, video dance,


  IF we can find evidence here, pre-interviews with carers can be helpful to be aware of common triggers.
bestPractices: >-
  - Individuals experiencing coginitive impairment may have
  concerns relating to decreasing memory. This can effect an individual's
  processing and understanding new scenarios and therefore ensuring that
  adequate time for informed consent is recommended. 

  - Heads up/ warning: Individuals may become frustrated if they realise they have forgotten something or are not understanding what is being told to them. Redirection away from their subject of concern may assist to divert further emotional distress as well as give the participant a new target of focus.
