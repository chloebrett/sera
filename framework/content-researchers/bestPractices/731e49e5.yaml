summary: Challenges blind software developers face
bestPractices: Commercial screen readers such as JAWS for Windows, and Non
  Visual Desktop Access were commonly used by the blind software engineers. Some
  users also use a refreshable Braille display which, can be easier to use for
  parentheses matching, or hexidecimal output instead of a confusing
  pronounciation given by a screen reader. Text editors were used over IDEs
  since they usually lack accessibility. Debugging tools also lack accessibility
  where participants use print statements instead. To get an overview of code,
  users usually read API document, and header files, it can difficult to get an
  idea of the overview without having to read the entire implementation.
  Out-of-context editing serves as a mechanism to predictably constrain cursor
  movement. When learning new tools, there may be a larger learning curve for
  blind developers compared to sighted developers since blind developers have
  less access to helpful features such as toolbar icons, and have more trouble
  navigating in general.
methodology: Qualitative interviews with legally blind software developers.
  Developers were recruited via a mailing list called Program-L which, serves
  blind software developers.
tools: Skype was used to conduct some interviews.
notesOfCaution: Be aware that some developers may feel insecure that they cannot
  complete tasks as quickly as fully sighted developers. Note that UML diagrams
  can be confusing and will usually require supplementary explanations. Diagrams
  in documentation, and visual languages can also be inaccessible.
