cohorts:
  - vision impaired
keywords:
  - blind
  - blindfolded
  - partially sighted
  - evaluation
targetAudience: General advice for conduting evaluations
summary: Reviews past research and recommends how this research area can be improved
bestPractices: >-
  - visual impairements other than blindness are under-represented
  so including these users in studies could provide more insight into this
  diverse population

  - conducting evaluations in the field could be easier to conduct when it is on the participant's own spaces and schedule

  - consider single subject design for quantitative evaluations to address issues such as difficulty in recruitment

  - look to other fields of research for approaches
