targetAudience: General advice for reporting evaluations
summary: Advice for reporting research involving participants with visual impairments
bestPractices: Report individual participant characteristics in a description
  table where possible, and in a way that does not risk privacy or security.
  Also report on standardized metrics on the group studied such as median age,
  gender education level, and past experience with related technologies. Where
  evaluations have a narrow aim and tasks, use the WHO classification for visual
  impairments. Otherwise, functional definitions for visual impairments are
  suited to evaluations that may not need a medical classification or comparison
  to other experiments. It is also important to provide transparency on issues
  encountered during the design and analysis of results to benefit the research
  community since this enables continuous review of standards.
