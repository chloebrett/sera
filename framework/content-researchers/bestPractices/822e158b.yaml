targetAudience: Computer professionals assessing the usability of computer
  products with children
findings: Do not schedule children for more than an hour of lab time.
  Preschoolers will last on average about 30 mins.
summary: Determining optimal lab time
notes: A usability testing lab is is a quiet room set up with computer equipment
  as well as a camera to record interactions, and a one-way mirror to an
  observation room.
bestPractices: Pre-school aged children typically require more time for play and
  exploration and will generally only last half an hour of concentrated computer
  use. Older children such as primary school or high school aged individuals,
  will typically become fatigued after an hour of concentrated computer use.
  Allow plenty of time between actors and do not over-schedule the day.
methodology: Usability testing, Interview, Observational
tools: Usability testing Lab.
