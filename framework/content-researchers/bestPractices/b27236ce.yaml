summary: Speech characteristics of individuals with cognitive communication disorders
bestPractices: Communication trends with individuals with CCDs do occur on a
  spectrum and therefore varies between individuals. Therefore, speech can vary
  from deficient or simplistic to unrestrained talkativeness. Individuals can
  also tend to repeat points or struggle with turn taking when speaking. They
  may struggle with finding the correct work they desire or structuring of
  sentences. Due to underlying cognitive skill impairments, individuals may also
  struggle with "attention, memory organisation, reasoning, social cognition or
  executive functions."
terminology: Cognitive communication disorders (CCDs) comprise a unique set of
  communication difficulties that can arise from a range of neurological insults
  including traumatic brain injury (TBI) and right hemisphere damage (RHD)
  associated with stroke or other causes, such as brain tumor. CCDs are
  ubiquitous for people with moderate to severe TBI
