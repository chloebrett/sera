  - user-centred design
targetAudience: Computer professionals assessing the usability of computer
  products with children
findings: Further dividing the children cohort into subgroups is important as
  different ages of children have different requirements.
summary: How to divide the children cohort
notes: A usability testing lab is is a quiet room set up with computer equipment
  as well as a camera to record interactions, and a one-way mirror to an
  observation room.
bestPractices: The cohort of children between 2 to 14 years of age can be
  further divided into distinct groups. In general, children in the groups with
  2-5, 6-10, and 11-14 years of age of age have slightly different testing
  requirements; therefore, it is important to specifically determine your target
  testing group. Children younger than 2.5 years are typically not proficient
  enough with standard input devices to interact with technology and provide
  useful data. Children older than 14 years will behave as adults in a testing
  situation and should be treated accordingly.
