  companies who are considering using their own product internally
bestPractices: >-
  - Within reason, the decision to dogfood should be made by
  internal users rather than an edict by management; doing otherwise can be
  dangerous.

  - Dogfooding should not be the only method of finding bugs, but it's a good supplement to more formal techniques.

  - Dogfooding is only useful if developers treat their own insights and internally identified issues with the same seriousness as those identified by paying customers.
terminology: dogfooding = the act of a company using its own product internally
