summary: Communication approaches to facilitate self expression of individuals
  with limited speech or non-verbal
bestPractices: >-
  When using assistive communication tools that is not personal to
  a participant, ensuring that the communication methods allow for individual
  expression as this may encourage more authentic expression of opinions. For
  example, ensuring communication aids allow for individuals to draw images or
  free text responses  enables participants to express their ideas rather than
  reducing their response to match a pre-written selection. 

  Schedule in frequent breaks as lengthy communication using assistive tools can also be fatiguing for participants. Having scheduled breaks rather than self-requested breaks allows for participant expectations to be clearly set throughout interview.
