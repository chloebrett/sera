targetAudience: Computer professionals assessing the usability of computer
  products with children
findings: Changing the order of tasks ensures that the same tasks do not come at
  the end of the test when children are tired.
summary: Change the ordering of tasks for different actors
notes: A usability testing lab is is a quiet room set up with computer equipment
  as well as a camera to record interactions, and a one-way mirror to an
  observation room.
bestPractices: Towards the end of a test, some children may run out of patience
  and the results of the testing may become biased. To mitigate this issue, the
  ordering of the tasks can be moved around for different actors to ensure that
  the results remain as unbiased as possible.
