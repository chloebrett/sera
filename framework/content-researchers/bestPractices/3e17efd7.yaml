  with Visual Impairments

cohorts:
  - vision impaired
subCohorts:
  - blind and vision impaired
  - low vision
keywords:
  - blind
  - blindfolded
  - partially sighted
targetAudience: Researchers who want to replace PVI with sighted participants
summary: Advice for replacing PVI participants with sighted participants
bestPractices: It is beneficial to involve PVI in the design process, especially
  for validating final design with the same population. Sighted participants may
  be helpful for formative or pilot studies, with PVI evaluations used later in
  the design and evaluation process. Sighted participants may also be used as a
  baseline, or used where they could also be a target user, as this may also
  help improve statistical significance
terminology: PVI = people with visual impairments
notesOfCaution: Do not use sighted participants for testing cognitive tasks
  since visual impairments have consequences on education, knowledge, and mental
  representations.
