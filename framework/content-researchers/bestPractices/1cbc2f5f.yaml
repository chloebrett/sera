paperName: A Blind Personâ€™s Interactions with Technology
paperLink: https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1536616.1536636
cohorts:
  - vision impaired
subCohorts:
  - blind
keywords:
  - congentially blind
findings: Technology and other tasks sometimes provided limitations but
  participant used workarounds that sometimes were more inefficient or made her
  less independent. Functionality and socially situated meaning will determine
  who uses technology and how it will be used.
summary: In-depth exploratory and descriptive case study of a blind person using
  various technology within her home.
notes: |-
  - Very accessible read
  - Had difficulties with participant recruitment
bestPractices: >-
  - home environment used to better represent nuances of using
  technology everyday as a blind person

  - ethnographically inspired investigation of a single participant (similar to social and behavioural sciences), although generalisations cannot be made

  - studying a single person allowed an in-depth investigation that brought out themes and patterns that may have been missed otherwise
methodology: |-
  - in-depth exploratory and descriptive case study 
  - one participant was interviewed and recorded six times over four weeks
  - Method adapted from Blythe et al "Technology Biographies"
