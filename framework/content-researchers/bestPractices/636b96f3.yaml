targetAudience: Computer professionals assessing the usability of computer
  products with children
findings: Children related to yourself or your colleagues are not ideal
  usability testing participants
summary: Avoid testing your own or colleague's children
notes: A usability testing lab is is a quiet room set up with computer equipment
  as well as a camera to record interactions, and a one-way mirror to an
  observation room.
bestPractices: Children whose parents work for software companies do not
  necessarily have advanced computer skills, however, they likely have
  above-average exposure to the products their parents develop. Additionally,
  children may be put in an awkward position if they have to provide negative
  feedback.
