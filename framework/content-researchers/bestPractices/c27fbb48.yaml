summary: User-centric software development methodology accounting for complex
  systems and prioritises stakeholder involvement
bestPractices: >-
  User-Centred Software Development Process (U-C SPD) methodology
  aims to assist developers in matching customer expectation and ensuring that
  privacy, security ethics, inclusion of stakeholders and verification and
  validation is prioritised.

  U-C SPD involves 3 primary loops that can be adjusted to be more reminiscent of either agile or waterfall models. 

  1.Initial scoping

  2.Main development

  3.Installation 

  This model has been proposed with the development and installation of intelligent environments, however the human-centered approach of integral stakeholder involvement may be appropriate when developing systems for those with specific needs. 

  Positives:

  - Primary and secondary users are able to voice concerns throughout product development

  - increased confidence in product appropriately meeting niche needs

  - Developers reported higher confidence that product will be received well.
