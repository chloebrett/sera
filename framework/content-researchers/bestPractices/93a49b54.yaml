cohorts:
  - vision impaired
keywords:

  - reporting
targetAudience: General advice for reporting evaluations
bestPractices: >-
  - report individual participant characterisitcs in a description
  table where possible, and in a way that does not risk privacy or security 

  - report standardized metrics on the group studied such as median age, gender education level, and past experience with related techologies 

  - use the WHO classification for visual impairments where evaluations have a narrow aim and tasks 

  - functional definitions for visual impairments are suited to evaluations that may not need a medical classification or comparison to other experiments 

  - provide transparency on issues encountered during the design and analysis of results to benefit the research community since this enables continuous review of standards
