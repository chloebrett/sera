summary: Algorithm for synthetic math speech - MathSpeak
bestPractices: The paper suggests that disability and non-disability populations
  can be used due to difficulty in recruiting participants, but only when
  non-disability group findings can be used to generalise disability group.
methodology: "Efficacy testing was performed in group sessions, with tasks and
  observations recorded. This study used two groups: college students with and
  without visual impairments. Groups completed the same tasks and were measured
  based on timing, pauses etc. when using different algorithms of MathSpeak."
tools: MathSpeak which, was evaluated in this study.
