summary: Strategies to increase the likelihood of successful task outcome in
  individuals with Alzheimers
bestPractices: Giving one prompt at a time will increase the likelihood that the
  individual will successfully complete the prompt. Asking close ended questions
  and paraphrased repitition are strategies available to be used and may need to
  be applied at different stages of disease progression. Using non-verbal
  gestures and slowed speech may be more beneficial at later staged of disease
  progression.
