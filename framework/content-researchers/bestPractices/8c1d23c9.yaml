summary: Advice for reviewing empirical research involving participants with
  visual impairments
bestPractices: >-
  - Be aware and considerate of difficulties researchers face
  during their evaluation to promote more inclusive practices as opposed to
  using the same quality metrics for other technologies

  - Small samples sizes may be appropriate for the study, and rejecting papers based on sample size may hinder research in the field

  - Pay attention to how evaluations are reported, especially to the comprehensiveness of the description of the participants
