  with Visual Impairments
paperLink: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376749
cohorts:
  - vision impaired
keywords:
  - blind
  - blindfolded
  - partially sighted
targetAudience: Researchers who want to replace PVI with sighted participants
bestPractices: >-
  - beneficial to involve PVI in the design process, especially for
  validating final design with the same population

  - sighted participants may be helpful for formative or pilot studies, with PVI evaluations later

  - sighted participants may be used as a baseline

  - sighted participants may be used where they could also be a target user, this may also help improve statistical significance
notesOfCaution: "- Do not use sighted participants for testing cognitive tasks
  since visual impairments have consequences on education, knowledge, and mental
  representations."
