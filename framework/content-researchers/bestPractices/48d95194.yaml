targetAudience: Computer professionals assessing the usability of computer
  products with children
findings: Younger children may have difficulty switching input devices from what
  they use at home.
summary: Match the input device that the child uses at home.
notes: A usability testing lab is is a quiet room set up with computer equipment
  as well as a camera to record interactions, and a one-way mirror to an
  observation room.
bestPractices: Pre-school aged children may have difficulty switching from the
  input device they use at home (touch screen, one button mouse, two button
  mouse etc.) to a different one in the lab. If it is possible to find out what
  they regularly use at home, set it up for them before the test.
