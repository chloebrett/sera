paperLink: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.3109/17483100903387226
cohorts:
  - vision impaired
subCohorts:
  - blind
  - low vision
keywords:
  - blindness
  - synthetic speech
  - college students
summary: Studied algorithm for synthetic math speech - MathSpeak
notes: |-
  - college students were used
  - accuracy of transmission used 18 non-visually impaired students
  - application used 21 non-impaired, and 6 impaired (3 blind and 3 low vision)
bestPractices: "- suggest that disability and non-disability populations be used
  due to difficulty in recruiting participants, but only when non-disability
  group findings can be used to generalise disability group"
methodology: >-
  - efficacy testing in group sessions

  - recorded observational study

  - participants were given tasks and reponses were recorded

  - used two groups: college student with and without visual impairements

  - groups completed the same tasks and were measured based on timing, pauses etc. when using different algorithms of MathSpeak
tools: "- evaluated MathSpeak"
