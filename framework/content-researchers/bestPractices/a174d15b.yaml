  with Visual Impairments
paperLink: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3313831.3376749
cohorts:
  - vision impaired
subCohorts:
  - blind and vision impaired
  - low vision
keywords:
  - blind
  - blindfolded
  - partially sighted
  - evaluation
targetAudience: General advice for conducting evaluations
summary: Advice for conducting research involving participants with visual
  impairments based on a review of the research area
bestPractices: >-
  - Visual impairments other than blindness are under-represented
  so including these users in studies could provide more insight into this
  diverse population

  - Conducting evaluations in the field could be easier to conduct when it is on the participant's own spaces and schedule

  - Consider single subject design for quantitative evaluations to address issues such as difficulty in recruitment

  - Explore other other fields of research for approaches to working with people with visual impairments
notesOfCaution: Users tend to want to please the designer, which is more
  pronounced for people with visual impairments. Beware of this bias.
