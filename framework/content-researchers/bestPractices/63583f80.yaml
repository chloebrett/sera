paperName: Guidelines for Designing Mobility and Orientation Software for Blind Children
paperLink: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-74796-3_35
cohorts:
  - vision impaired
  - children
subCohorts:
  - blind
  - primary school
  - high school
keywords:
  - blind
  - children
  - mobility and orientation
findings: From the interviews, the children use landmarks to navigate, and found
  it is important to provide contextualised information of surroundings. The
  most efficient path isn't always used by blind people due to other factors
  such as paths that require less cognitive demand, or have more landmarks.
notes: "- 5 blind people between 20-32, and 7 blind children 8-14, M&O
  specialists and special education teachers also involved"
bestPractices: >-
  - when teaching routes, landmarks are essential

  - tips for kids: make it game-orientated to help them learn and produce higher commitment

  - use audio cues including non-spoken sounds
methodology: >-
  - open, unstructured interview with recorded audio

  - written observations

  - recommended for navigation design: formative and summative end-user usability evaluations. Methods such as heuristic evaluations, and cognitive walkthroughs to reveal hidden requirements.
notesOfCaution: >-
  - be aware of obstacles that blind people cannot detect with
  their aids such as chandeliers, and beams

  - be aware that blind people use temporal information for navigation
