  - Developer experience is analogous to user experience, with the
  key difference being that the user’s goal is to use a product or service,
  while the developer’s goal is to create a product or service.

  - Developer experience includes a number of facets, with some being technical (for example, the tools used) and others being more human (e.g. the perceived value of one’s own contribution to a team).
