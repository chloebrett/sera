bestPractices: >-
  - be aware and considerate of difficulties researchers face
  during their evaluation to promote more inclusive practices as opposed to
  using the same quality metrics for other technologies

  - small samples sizes may be appropriate for the study, rejecting papers based on sample size may hinder research in the field

  - pay attention to how evaluations are reported, especially to the comprehensiveness of the description of the participants
