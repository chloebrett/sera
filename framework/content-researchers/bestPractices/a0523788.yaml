  * Intelligent environments -> the use of sensing technology and
  innovative interaction devices interconnected with a network and supplemented
  with intelligent and contextaware software to create useful services for
  humans in whatever space and time they need support. 

  * Problem identified: lack of methodologies and tools to support developers connected to a strategy which guides them through the process in a way so as to increase their chances of success.

  * Development process proposed/ used - flexible but user-centred iterative process

  * Our focus is on how to put together technology and create the software which allows the infrastructure to provide the required services. - Foundation of alot of assumptions ie - the sensors already exists, not worried about creation of artefacts

  * management aspects such as governance and stakeholder involvement. Further challenges relate to the gaining of confidence in system operation, in terms of behavioural correctness, performance qualities, and their validation.

  * Heart of this approach is "fluid dialog with the stakeholders" to agree on how the different ingredients can be put to work in an acceptable way for everyone

  * Verification and validation is key

  * This method also has privacy and security ethics at the heart of the process

  * ABOUT THE METHOD - : initial

  scoping, main development and IE installation

  Methodology: User-Centred Software Development Process ( U-C SPD)
  methodology aims to assist developers in matching customer expectation and
  ensuring that privacy, security ethics, inclusion of stakeholders and
  verification and validation is prioritised. 

  - Involves 3 primary loops that can be adjusted to be more reminiscent of either agile or waterfall models. 

  1. Initial scoping

  2. Main development

  3. Installation 

  This model has been proposed with the development and installation of intelligent environments, however the human-centered approach of intergral stakeholder involvement may be appropriate when developing systems for those with specific needs. 

  Positives:

  - Primary and secondary users are able to voice concerns throughout product development

  - increased confidence in product appropriately meeting niche needs

  - Developers reported higher confidence that product will be received well.
