paperName: "Applying Web Usability Criteria for Vision-Impaired Users: Does It
  Really Improve Task Performance?"
paperLink: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10447310701771472
cohorts:
  - vision impaired
subCohorts:
  - blind
  - low vision
keywords:
  - remote
findings: Both blind and low-vision users benefitted from the criteria and
  showed reduced navigation times to complete tasks.
summary: Measured the impact web usability criteria had on the vision-impaired
  user experience
notes: Good read, very detailed methodology
bestPractices: >-
  - remote evaluation allowed users to interact with applications
  in a familiar environment

  - bias of ability avoided by allowing participants to practice JAWS commands before testing so they all have similar basic skills

  - bias of familiarity avoided by allowing users preliminary navigation on both website versions, and reversing the test order for half of participants
methodology: >-
  - remote user testing with two groups of of 20 visually impaired
  users (mix of blind and low vision), ages ranged from 25-68

  - users already had experience with the software and screen reader with most having taken targetted courses by the Association for the Blind

  - results were obtained via a questionnaire form that was sent at least 3 times

  - client-side automatic logging was also used as a remote evaluation techqnie
tools: >-
  - all users needed screen reader (JAWS) to navigate the website

  - client-side automatic logging to detect and record user interactions

  - tasks were indicated by a "Wizard-based method" which gave users step-by-step instructions using dialogue
notesOfCaution: "- remote evaluation made it more difficult to set the
  client-side environment required for testing, and some users had difficulty
  downloading and installing the Java plug-in"
