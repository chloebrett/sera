bestPractices: >-
  Augmentative and alternative communication refers to including a
  range of communication methods including tools such as communication books,
  devices or charts. Using such tools that are familiar to  participants  allow
  for individuals with severe, profound or multiple intellectual disabilities to
  communicate using strategies familiar to them. 


  Individual vocabularies can be viewed as originating from a vocabulary hierarchy - core, local and individual vocabularies for each individual.  Core vocabularies are those shared within a local wide area and tend to not change much over time. Local vocabularies are shared between fewer individuals and can relate to subjects such as "shared support staff, day centers or town". Individual vocabularies are those terms that are unique to that individual's life such as a friends, carer or item. 

  It is suggested to complete pre-interviews or assessments with an individual or carers to understand an individual's communication needs and ascertain their vocabulary hierarchy. The goals of this stage is to understand the preparatory time required for the interviews, understanding how research responses/ questions need to be altered as well as an opportunity for carers/ individuals to raise any concerns about the interview


  When conducting interviews:

  - Having personalised consent letters to ensure each individual is able to give informed consent via their preferred communication method

  - In some cases, attaching photographs of the researchers who will be interviewing the participant can assist in familiarising the researchers to the participant. 

  - Being conscious of the communication environment - including physical aspects such as noise, light and distracting factors .
